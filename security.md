## Security

We take the security of our software products and components seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our [Fulll's GitHub organization](https://github.com/fulll).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Fulll's repository that meets Wikipedia's definition of a security vulnerability ([English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)), [French version](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuln%C3%A9rabilit%C3%A9_(informatique))), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting security vulnerability Issues

:warning: **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, **please report them by email** to [rssi@fulll.fr](mailto:rssi@fulll.fr).

You should receive a response as soon as possible. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to our  [Administrator Team](mailto:admin@fulll.fr) to ensure we received your original message.

For private repositories, you can also send an email or directly use the dedicated issue template for security vulnerability.

:bulb: In any ways, please include the requested information listed below (**as much as you can provide**) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. Denial of service, Elevation of privilege, Information disclosure, Remote Code Execution, Security feature bypass, buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue, including any special configuration required to reproduce
* (if possible) Proof-of-concept or exploit code
* Description and Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English, but if you are not comfortable, French is acceptable too.
